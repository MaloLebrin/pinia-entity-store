### How Can I Contribute?

#### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain pinia-entity-store's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Enable a sustainable system for pinia-entity-store's maintainers to review contributions

You can create PR as your wish to fix bug, and create features


## How to use It ?

üî¥ At the moment the package is not released yet, because it is still young.
It has no published release on github.
You can obviously make changes to contribute to the projects in order to advance the roadmap

‚úÖ However the features of Pinia Entity Store can be used without concern. They are tested and already used in some projects

### Install package

```
npm i @malolebrin/pinia-entity-store

// or

yarn add @malolebrin/pinia-entity-store

// or

pnpm i @malolebrin/pinia-entity-store

```


### Create the state

```ts
// userState.ts

import { createState } from '@malolebrin/pinia-entity-store'
import type { UserEntity } from '~/types'

export const userState = createState<UserEntity>()
```

The state will look like this:

```ts
  entities: {
    byId: Record<number, UserEntity>,
    allIds: number[]
    current: UserEntity | null
    active: number[]
  }
```

You can of course extend the state as much and as you want.

### Create the store


```ts
// useUserStore.ts
import { createActions, createGetters } from '@malolebrin/pinia-entity-store'
import type { UserEntity } from '../../types'
import { userState } from './userState.ts'

export const useUserStore = defineStore('user', {
  state: () => ({ ...userState }),

  getters: {
    ...createGetters<UserEntity>(userState),

    // your customs getters bellow
  },

  actions: {
    // Actions from Pinia-entity-store
    ...createActions<UserEntity>(userState),

    // your customs actions bellow
    resetState() {
      this.$state = defaultState()
    }
  }
})
```
